# Gitignore
You can create '.gitignore' file which not add some file from repo to gitcloud.
You can automaticly generate '.gitignore' file in website [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore).

For example for Linux:
```
# Created by https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/linux
# Edit at https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?templates=linux

### Linux ###
*~

# temporary files which can be created if a process still has a handle open of a deleted file
.fuse_hidden*

# KDE directory preferences
.directory

# Linux trash folder which might appear on any partition or disk
.Trash-*

# .nfs files are created when an open file is removed but is still being accessed
.nfs*
